        <p id="progress-clearance">Our framers gave us a “representative democracy” — what they called, “a Republic.” But that Republic was to be representative of all of us. Congress, as Madison said, was to be “dependent on the People alone.” And by “the People,” as he explained, they meant “not the rich more than the poor.”</p>

        <h2>Election Funding</h2>

        <p>The root problem in America’s democracy is how we fund campaigns. America has outsourced the funding of campaigns to the tiniest fraction of the 1% — dominated by cronies and special interests, and by too many who care too little about the good for America as a whole. That system for funding campaigns produces a Congress dominated by cronies and special interests. That dependence is a kind of corruption.</p>
        <p>We need to change the way campaigns are funded to end this corruption. We need a system in which all of us — and not just the interested few — fund campaigns, so we can have a Congress dependent on all of us, and not just the interested few.</p>
        <p>So we are launching a plan to recruit Americans across the country to help convince members of Congress to support fundamental reform in the way campaigns are funded.</p>
        <p>The corruption of our U.S. government can be overwhelming. Fixing it feels impossible. But the solution is actually quite simple.</p>
        <p>Right now, members of Congress must raise huge sums of money to win elections. And that requires spending 30–70% of their time raising money from wealthy donors and special interests. The incentives are clear: more money = higher chance of getting elected. And more money comes from pleasing their donors, creating a system of cronyism.</p>
        <p>To fix it, we just need to change the incentives so that instead of working for wealthy funders, they are instead fighting for the support of voters.</p>

        <h2>A Congress Committed to Reform</h2>

        <p>We are demanding that members of Congress cosponsor legislation that will reverse the corrupting influence of money on our elections. Five pieces of legislation currently meet our standards for a more inclusive way of funding political campaigns: two from Democrats, two from Republicans, and one bipartisan bill. To learn more about these plans, visit <a href="http://www.reform.to/#/reforms">http://www.reform.to/#/reforms</a></p>
        <p>Whether we give ordinary Americans more influence in our elections through matching their donations, providing vouchers, or instituting tax credits is not important to us as long as the bill meaningfully addresses the systemic of corruption in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>To increase the momentum for reform, our strategy is to start by targeting the members of Congress most likely to support reform: those who are new to Congress and those who have supported reform in the past but have not yet recommitted in the 114th Congress. Reform legislation already has the support of over 200 legislators, so we need to close the gap.</p>

        <h2>The Mayday Laboratory</h2>

        <p>Our campaign will experiment with the most effective tools of persuasion: money and popular support. We are organizing grassroots campaigns to show members of Congress that doing the right thing for our republic is also essential for their political future. And we’re going to hit them where it hurts by organizing donors to withhold their contributions to all candidates who do not support reform.</p>
        <p>Our campaign will double-down on what works and let go of what doesn’t. Volunteers and supporters will play a vital role in creating a Congress committed to reform. And we are eager to hear from you about how to make this effort a success.</p>
        <p>In 2015, Mayday will focus on generating support for reform within the Congress we already have. As the 2016 election approaches, we will explore the most effective means for Mayday to make a difference.</p>
        <p>We are counting on you to be a part of our efforts to get our democracy back. Please <a href="/take_action">sign-up to take action</a> and spread the word to your friends and family. Too much is at stake to sit on the sidelines.</p>
