          <h3 >Mark McKinnon</h3>
          <h4>Founder, Board Treasurer</h4>
          <p>
            For three decades, Mark McKinnon has been solving complex strategic challenges for causes, companies, and candidates, including George W. Bush, John McCain, Ann Richards, and Bono. He has helped engineer five winning presidential primary and general election campaigns, and is a cofounder of No Labels, a non-profit organization dedicated to bipartisanship, civil discourse and problem solving in politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Broadcasting and Cable magazine, McKinnon is one of “a handful of players behind every big decision, consensus or roadblock in Washington…putting a unique, sometimes hidden stamp on the outcome of today’s debates.” Politics Daily writes: “He’s known for his originality in a field typified by copycats, a mellow personality in a world populated with high-strung brutes and ecumenical urges in a profession dominated by its unadulterated partisans.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Former President George W. Bush says of McKinnon, “I was really impressed by Mark’s creativity, and I was particularly impressed by his honesty.” Senator John McCain, in his typical straight-talk fashion, remarks, “He’s almost a genius.” And President Barack Obama calls McKinnon “a class act.”
          </p>
          <p>
            President Bush appointed McKinnon to serve as a governor of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. He serves on the board of the Austin Film Society, and has taught at the JFK School of Government at Harvard University and the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. McKinnon currently is a consultant to the HBO television series, The Newsroom.
