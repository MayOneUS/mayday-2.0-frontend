    <h1>Keep the fight going against corruption in the 2016 elections.</h1>
    <p>We're proud of everything Zephyr Teachout accomplished as CEO and Board Chair of MAYDAY.US. We need more reformers to join Representatives Walter Jones and John Sarbanes and other reform leaders in fighting for reform on the floor of the U.S. Congress.  Now it's on each of us to step up and win the national fight!</p>
    <p>At MAYDAY.US, we believe that the root issue in American democratic failure is the way politicians raise money. Every other issue is connected to privately financed campaigns.</p>
    <p>We are up against some of the most powerful anti-democratic forces in the world, and need people power to fight.</p>
    <p>Public elections are a feminist issue. They are a race issue. They are a democracy issue. They are a power issue.</p>
    <p><strong>Show your power and join our movement.</strong></p>

    <blockquote class="visible-md-block visible-lg-block"><p>&ldquo;Corruption is the issue hiding in plain sight in the 2016 campaign. Together, we’ll continue the MAYDAY.US spirit of dreaming big, trying new things, and striking at the root of corruption with large, unafraid actions. With all hands on deck, we can overcome legalized bribery and achieve political equality. Let's address a big problem with bold action.&rdquo;</p> <p class="quote-author">- Zephyr Teachout</p></blockquote>
