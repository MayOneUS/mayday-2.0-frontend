      <h2><strong>Elect proven, effective reformer: Jamie Raskin.</strong></h2>
      <p>Don't let big money from David Trone or lobbyist Kathleen Matthews buy this Congressional seat. Stand against corruption. </p>
      <p><strong>Jamie Raskin is the only major candidate who has experience passing reform to make sure government listens to YOU, not to lobbyists.</strong></p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re backing Jamie Raskin, one of the most effective leaders in the country because he consistently puts the people over special interests.</p>
      <h3 class="margin-bottom-sm">Why we're endorsing Jamie Raskin to get big special interest money out of politics.</h3>

      <p>Jamie is a powerful voice for reform who has spent his entire career fighting to end corruption from big money in politics. He focuses on the people and advocates for a better democracy. A law professor at American University, Jamie literally wrote the campaign finance reform book about the &ldquo;wealth primary.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong>The stakes could not be more clear.</strong> Jamie&rsquo;s donations come from his district voters, the people he&rsquo;s fighting to represent. His main opponent&rsquo;s donations come from investment bankers, Fortune 500 executives, and DC insiders.</p>
      <p>Kathleen Matthews thinks the way to do things is with a well-connected few. She&rsquo;s a corporate lobbyist who represents powerful interests and politics as usual.</p>
      <p>David Trone's and Kathleen Matthews's Big Money is outpacing Jamie&rsquo;s grassroots campaign. They're outspending him, primarily from special interests.</p>
      <p><strong>Help us fight back and elect a leader for reform to Rep. Chris Van Hollen's open congressional seat!</strong></p>
