    <p>A historic protest called Democracy Spring just wrapped up a 10-day march from Philadelphia to DC, followed by thousands from across the country converging on Capitol Hill for a massive series of sit-ins & demonstrations, including celebrities like Mark Ruffalo and Gaby Hoffman.</p>
    <p>I co-founded MAYDAY.US with hopes of 2016 being a tipping point moment for reform. We’re beginning to see the promise of that launch, and it’s because so many of you from across the country have committed to a principled fight for political equality.</p>
    <p><strong>Please give whatever you can to keep this fight alive.</strong></p>
